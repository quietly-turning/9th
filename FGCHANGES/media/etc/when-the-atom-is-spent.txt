korean localizer:
  there's a phrase "atom is spent"

quietly-turning:
  there sure is

korean localizer:
  and initially i thought she was referring to atomic explosion
  i looked up the date of the letter
  and it couldn't be it
  and i'm still not exactly sure about it

quietly-turning:
  it's a curious turn of phrase

korean localizer:
  so here i said "like scattering winds after"
  i initially had it as "like scattering winds after the eruption"
  but i went towards the vague way
  i thought explicitly saying the eruption was too clear and too strong
  when it's followed by "shower of delicate notes"

quietly-turning:
  poetry :)

korean localizer:
  what about u?
  what do u think that phrase means

quietly-turning:
  I'll consult google ngrams at some point, but until then
  
  Bohr's proposed model of the atom as the fundamental unit of the
  universe would have been established and recent at the time of writing
  
  (checking wikipedia, he received the nobel prize in physics for it in
  1922, so yeah!)
  
  with that context, I always took the phrase to suggest "when all energy
  needed to propel this creative thing has been used" not in a heat death
  sense, but evoking-the-language-of-physics-for-poetic-effect, as though
  atoms are consumable units of effort and work
  
  gotta say,
  it is easier/lighter to dance around thinly-veiled dick jokes while
  working on peacock for LEFTS, than to deliberate the idiosyncrasies of
  Ms. Keller's word choices from a century ago but i'm glad both can exist
  (o, the duality of man) and wouldn't want it any other way
