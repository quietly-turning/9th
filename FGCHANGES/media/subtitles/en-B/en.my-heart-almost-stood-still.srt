00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.760
Dear friends,
I have the joy
of being able to tell you

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.920
that I spent a glorious hour last night
listening over the radio
to Beethoven's ninth symphony.

3
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.200
Last night, when the family was listening
to your wonderful rendering
of the immortal symphony,

4
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.400
someone suggested that I put my hand
on the receiver and see if I could
get any of the vibrations.

5
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.560
He unscrewed the cap
and I lightly touched
the sensitive diaphragm.

6
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.880
What was my amazement to discover
that I could feel not only the vibrations,

7
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.200
but also the impassioned rhythm,
the throb, and the urge of the music.

8
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.800
The intertwined and intermingling vibrations
from different instruments enchanted me.

9
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:49.600
I could actually distinguish the cornets,
the roll of the drums,
deep toned violas and violins
singing in exquisite unison.

10
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.160
How the lovely speech of the violins
flowed and plowed over the deepest tones
of the other instruments.

11
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.640
When the human voices leapt up,
thrilling from the surge of harmony,
I recognized them instantly as voices.

12
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.640
I felt the chorus grow more exultant,
more ecstatic, upcurving,
swift, and flamelike

13
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.840
until my heart almost stood still.

14
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:21.680
The women's voices seemed an embodiment
of all the angelic voices
rushing in a harmonious flood
of beautiful and inspiring sound.

15
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.560
The great chorus throbbed against my fingers
with poignant pause and flow.

16
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.600
Then all the instruments and voices together
burst forth an ocean of heavenly vibration

17
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.440
and died away,
like winds when the atom is spent,
ending in a delicate shower
of sweet notes.

18
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:50.960
Of course, this was not "hearing," but
I do know that the tones and harmonies
conveyed to me moods of
great beauty and majesty.

19
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.880
I also sensed, or thought I did,
the tender sounds of nature
that sing into my hand:

20
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.520
swaying reeds,
and winds,
and the murmur of streams.

21
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.760
I have never been so enraptured before
by a multitude of tone vibrations.

22
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.680
As I listened with darkness and melody
and shadow and sound filling all the room,

23
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:22.560
I could not help remembering that
the great composer who poured forth
such a flood of sweetness into the world
was deaf like myself.

24
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:31.280
I marveled at the power
of his quenchless spirit
by which out of his pain he
wrought such joy for others.

25
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:42.480
And there I sat,
feeling with my hand
the magnificent symphony
which broke like a sea
upon the silent shores
of his soul and mine.

26
00:02:42.480 -->  00:02:50.480
Let me thank you warmly for all the delight
which your beautiful music has brought
to my household and to me.

27
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.360
With kindest regards and best wishes,

28
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.720
I am sincerely yours,
Helen Keller.
