00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,960
Dear friends,
I have the joy of being able to tell you

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:12,800
that I spent a glorious hour last night
listening over the radio
to Beethoven's ninth symphony.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,400
Last night, when the family was listening
to your wonderful rendering
of the immortal symphony,

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:26,529
someone suggested that I put my hand
on the receiver and see if I could get
any of the vibrations.

5
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:32,028
He unscrewed the cap
and I lightly touched the sensitive diaphragm.

6
00:00:32,028 --> 00:00:39,026
What was my amazement to discover
that I could feel not only the vibrations,

7
00:00:39,026 --> 00:00:46,025
but also the impassioned rhythm,
the throb, and the urge of the music.

8
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:52,024
The intertwined and intermingling vibrations
from different instruments enchanted me.

9
00:00:52,024 --> 00:01:02,080
I could actually distinguish the cornets,
the role of the drums, deep tone violas,
and violins, singing in exquisite unison.

10
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:09,520
How the lovely speech of the violins
flowed and plowed over the deepest tones
of the other instruments.

11
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:17,019
When the human voice leapt up,
trilling from the surge of harmony,
I recognized them instantly as voices.

12
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:23,551
I felt the chorus grow more exultant,
more ecstatic, upcurving,
swift, and flamelike,

13
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:26,683
until my heart almost stood still.

14
00:01:26,683 --> 00:01:35,815
The women's voices seemed an embodiment
of all the angelic voices
rushing in a harmonious flood
of beautiful and inspiring sound.

15
00:01:35,815 --> 00:01:42,047
The great chorus throbbed against my fingers
with poignant pause and flow.

16
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:49,612
Then all the instruments and voices together
burst forth an ocean of heavenly vibration

17
00:01:49,612 --> 00:01:58,177
and died away,
like winds when the atom is spent,
ending in a delicate shower of sweet notes.

18
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:09,508
Of course this was not "hearing,"
but I do know that the tones and harmonies
conveyed to me moods of great beauty and majesty.

19
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:16,340
I also sensed, or thought I did,
the tender sounds of nature
that sing into my hand:

20
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,673
swaying reeds,
and winds,
and the murmur of streams.

21
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:27,671
I have never been so enraptured before
by a multitude of tone vibrations.

22
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:33,437
As I listened with darkness and melody,
shadow and sound filling all the room,

23
00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:43,402
I could not help remembering that the great composer
who poured forth such a flood of sweetness into the world
was deaf like myself.

24
00:02:43,402 --> 00:02:52,332
I marveled at the power of his quenchless spirit
by which out of his pain
he wrought such joy for others.

25
00:02:52,332 --> 00:03:04,640
And there I sat, feeling with my hand
the magnificent symphony which broke like a sea
upon the silent shores of his soul and mine.

26
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:12,696
Let me thank you warmly for all the delight
which your beautiful music has brought
to my household and to me.

27
00:03:12,996 --> 00:03:16,073
With kindest regards and best wishes,

28
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:19,995
I am sincerely yours,
Helen Keller
