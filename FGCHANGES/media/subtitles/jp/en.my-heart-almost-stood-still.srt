00:00:01.361 --> 00:00:07.952
Dear friends,
I have the joy
of being able to tell you

2
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.253
that I spent a glorious hour last night
listening over the radio
to Beethoven's ninth symphony.

3
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:17.286
Last night, when the family
was listening to your wonderful
rendering of the immortal symphony,

4
00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:25.023
someone suggested that I put my hand
on the receiver and see if I could get
any of the vibrations.

5
00:00:25.354 --> 00:00:30.489
He unscrewed the cap
and I lightly touched
the sensitive diaphragm.

6
00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.604
What was my amazement
to discover that I could feel
not only the vibrations,

7
00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:39.862
but also the impassioned rhythm,
the throb, and the urge of the music.

8
00:00:40.204 --> 00:00:44.100
The intertwined
and intermingling vibrations
from different instruments
enchanted me.

9
00:00:44.668 --> 00:00:53.811
I could actually distinguish
the cornets,
the roll of the drums,
deep tone violas,
and violins,
singing in exquisite unison.

10
00:00:54.276 --> 00:00:59.581
How the lovely speech of the violins
flowed and plowed over the deepest tones
of the other instruments.

11
00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.554
When the human voice leapt up,
trilling from the surge of harmony,
I recognized them instantly as voices.

12
00:01:08.058 --> 00:01:13.202
I felt the chorus grow more exultant,
more ecstatic, upcurving,
swift, and flamelike,

13
00:01:13.496 --> 00:01:15.288
until my heart almost stood still.

14
00:01:16.162 --> 00:01:24.936
The women's voices seemed an embodiment
of all the angelic voices
rushing in a harmonious flood
of beautiful and inspiring sound.

15
00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:30.564
The great chorus
throbbed against my fingers
with poignant pause and flow.

16
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:34.369
Then all the instruments
and voices together
burst forth an ocean
of heavenly vibration

17
00:01:34.568 --> 00:01:43.177
and died away, like winds
when the atom is spent,
ending in a delicate shower
of sweet notes.

18
00:01:43.823 --> 00:01:52.000
Of course this was not "hearing," but
I do know that the tones and harmonies
conveyed to me moods of
great beauty and majesty.

19
00:01:52.683 --> 00:01:59.726
I also sensed, or thought I did,
the tender sounds of nature
that sing into my hand:

20
00:02:00.457 --> 00:02:04.401
swaying reeds,
and winds,
and the murmur of streams.

21
00:02:05.265 --> 00:02:09.455
I have never been
so enraptured before
by a multitude of tone vibrations.

22
00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.650
As I listened
with darkness and melody,
shadow and sound
filling all the room,

23
00:02:15.258 --> 00:02:22.521
I could not help remembering
that the great composer
who poured forth such a flood
of sweetness into the world
was deaf like myself.

24
00:02:23.157 --> 00:02:32.489
I marveled at the power
of his quenchless spirit
by which out of his pain
he wrought such joy for others.

25
00:02:33.296 --> 00:02:41.103
And there I sat,
feeling with my hand
the magnificent symphony
which broke like a sea
upon the silent shores
of his soul and mine.

26
00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.702
Let me thank you warmly
for all the delight
which your beautiful music
has brought to my household
and to me.

27
00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.462
With kindest regards and best wishes,

28
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I am sincerely yours,
Helen Keller
